The city wakes slowly. I began the morning walking through Maruyama Park, where the soft crunch of gravel underfoot and distant calls of birds made me forget how close I was to a bustling city.

## The Streets of Gion

Wandering into Gion, the traditional wooden townhouses glowed under the early light. A couple of streets away, the hum of modern Kyoto resumed — but here, it still felt like the 1800s.

## A Stop for Tea

Later in the afternoon, I stopped for matcha and wagashi near Nanzen-ji. I had the place to myself, and the garden framed by the tearoom’s window was a perfect still life.

It’s not always the destination. Sometimes, it’s this: the walk, the view, the quiet.
