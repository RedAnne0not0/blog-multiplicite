# Hugo Blogs Monorepo

This repository houses all self-hosted Hugo blogs, organized for flexible content creation, publishing, and future automation.

## Structure

blogs/
├── blog-personal/       # Personal blog (general writing, essays, etc.)
├── blog-multiplicite/   # Multiplicité blog (specialized content)
└── .gitignore           # Monorepo-level Git exclusions

## Usage

Each blog functions independently as a Hugo site. Content is drafted in [Logseq](../logseq/knowledge-graph/pages/) and then staged here when ready for editing or publishing.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add build/deploy automation.
- [ ] Define theme customizations.
- [ ] Link to hosting or publishing setup.
